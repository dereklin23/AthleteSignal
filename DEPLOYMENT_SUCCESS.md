# Athlete Signal - Successfully Deployed! 🎉

**Live URL:** https://athlete-signal-production.up.railway.app

## Deployment Summary

Athlete Signal has been successfully deployed to Railway with the following setup:

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting:** Railway (https://railway.app)
- **Domain:** athlete-signal-production.up.railway.app (free Railway subdomain)
- **Database:** Redis (for production session storage)
- **Port:** 8080
- **Environment:** Production

### Services Running
- ✅ Express.js API Server
- ✅ Redis Session Store
- ✅ OAuth2 Authentication (Strava + Oura)
- ✅ Static File Serving
- ✅ Protected Routes with Session Management

### Configuration Details

**Environment Variables Set:**
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `SESSION_SECRET` (secure random token)
- `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID` / `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `STRAVA_REDIRECT_URI`
- `OURA_CLIENT_ID` / `OURA_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `OURA_REDIRECT_URI`
- `REDIS_URL` (auto-configured by Railway)

**OAuth Redirect URIs:**
- Strava: `athlete-signal-production.up.railway.app` (Authorization Callback Domain)
- Oura: `https://athlete-signal-production.up.railway.app/auth/oura/callback`

### Key Deployment Steps Completed

1. ✅ Created Railway project from GitHub repository
2. ✅ Added Redis database for session storage
3. ✅ Generated Railway domain
4. ✅ **Fixed port configuration** (changed from 3000 to 8080) ⚠️
5. ✅ Configured environment variables
6. ✅ Updated Strava and Oura OAuth redirect URIs
7. ✅ Verified deployment with successful health checks

### Important Notes

#### Port Configuration ⚠️
The most critical step was setting the correct port. Railway initially generated the domain with port 3000, but the app runs on port 8080. This was fixed in:
- **Settings → Networking → Public Networking → Edit Domain → Port: 8080**

Without this configuration, the app would show "Application failed to respond" (502 errors) even though the server was running correctly.

#### Server Initialization
The app uses an async startup function (`startServer()`) that:
1. Connects to Redis first
2. Configures session middleware
3. Sets up routes
4. Starts listening on 0.0.0.0:8080

This ensures proper initialization order and prevents race conditions.

### Monitoring

**Check Deployment Status:**
- Railway Dashboard → Athlete Signal service → "Deploy Logs" tab

**Expected Log Output:**
```
[REDIS] [INFO] Successfully connected to Redis
[SESSION] [INFO] Using Redis session store
[SESSION] [INFO] Session middleware configured
[INFO] Server running on port 8080
[INFO] Listening on 0.0.0.0:8080
[INFO] Environment: production
[INFO] Ready to accept connections
```

### Cost

- **Railway Free Tier:** $5 credit/month
- **Estimated Usage:** ~$2-4/month
- **Status:** Within free tier limits ✅

### Future Improvements (Optional)

1. **Custom Domain:** Purchase `athletesignal.com` and connect to Railway
2. **Monitoring:** Add application monitoring (e.g., Sentry)
3. **CI/CD:** Set up automated testing before deployment
4. **Database Backup:** Configure Redis persistence/backups
5. **Rate Limiting:** Add API rate limiting for production

### Access

**Public URL:** https://athlete-signal-production.up.railway.app

**Features Available:**
- User authentication via Strava + Oura OAuth
- Personal dashboard with training and recovery metrics
- Date range selection (Today, Last 7/30 days, This/Last Month/Year)
- Interactive charts with sleep and running data
- Session-based authentication with Redis persistence
