## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Smart Contextual Display
Both the goals section and weekly mileage chart now intelligently show/hide based on the selected date range:

- **Single-Day Views** ("Today"): Both hidden for a clean, focused view
- **Multi-Day Views** (Weekly, Monthly, Yearly): Both visible with full insights

This keeps the interface clean and contextually relevant, showing information only when it's meaningful.

## 🎓 Technical Details

### Goal Tracking Architecture

**Storage:** Browser localStorage under key `athlete_signal_goals`

**Data Structure:**
```javascript
{
  weekly: {
    mileage: { enabled: boolean, target: number, current: number },
    runs: { enabled: boolean, target: number, current: number },
    avgSleep: { enabled: boolean, target: number, current: number },
    avgReadiness: { enabled: boolean, target: number, current: number }
  },
  monthly: { /* same structure */ },
  streaks: {
    consecutiveSleepGoal: number,
    consecutiveRunDays: number,
    consecutiveReadinessGoal: number,
    bestSleepStreak: number,
    bestRunStreak: number,
    bestReadinessStreak: number
  },
  lastUpdated: string
}
```

**Calculations:**
- Weekly goals: Last 7 days of data
- Monthly goals: Current calendar month
- Streaks: Consecutive days meeting criteria
- Progress: (current / target) × 100

### Weekly Mileage Algorithm

1. **Group by Week:** Data grouped by calendar week (Sunday-Saturday)
2. **Aggregate:** Sum mileage and count runs per week
3. **Rolling Average:** Calculate 4-week moving average
4. **Render:** Bar chart for totals, line chart for average

**Performance:**
- Time complexity: O(n) where n = number of days
- Space complexity: O(w) where w = number of weeks
- Efficient for large date ranges
